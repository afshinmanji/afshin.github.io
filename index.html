<h1> My Reflections... </h1>
<p>
I love coding! I have done this before but forgot everything, so this is a great refresher. </br>
</br>
Can't lie, I'd rather be here! See below :)<br/>

<h2> Going Forward! </h2>
<p>
Hopefully I remember more after this class and get to code at this beach. </br>
</br>
I will keep practicing. Don't worry! </br>
